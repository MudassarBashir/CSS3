					Up for a little artistic expression? If so, you're in the right spot. Here, you'll get to express your every creative whim with Adobe Flash's set of drawing tools. <span style="background-color: yellow; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt;">You'll see how to create artistic and painterly effects for use in your movies with the Pencil, Brush, and Pen tools, as well as a few others thrown in for good measure.</span> Now, the thing to remember as you're using Flash's drawing tools is that you're creating vector objects. Vector objects are scalable and won't loose their quality when they play back for your viewers. In other words, you can size 'em bigger or smaller, and they'll always look crisp and clean. And as we've already discussed, it's this vector behaviour that really makes Flash so unique. So, not only does Flash allow for animation and movement, but it creates everything in this scalable, vector environment. But we'll get to all the good animation stuff later on in Chapter 8. To find out more about vector objects, be sure to check out the sidebar <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"The Happs in Graphics: Raster vs. Vector."</span>
